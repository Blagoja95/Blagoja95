  - [Job board web app](https://github.com/Blagoja95/job-posting-web-app) Crown jewel of my repos, this app is Job board web app made with ReactJS, TailwindCSS and JAVA EE. Running back-end on Tomcat and storing data using MySQL RDBMS and administering it using phpMyAdmin. All parts containerized using Docker together with docker compose tool to handle all images, containers and other configurations.

  - [Recipe app](https://recipe-app-demo-bb.netlify.app)  allows its user to search over a million of different recipes. Add new recipes, filter recipes by keyword like ingredient or find specific recipe with a search bar. A user also has the option of creating their own recipe. This application is made with the MVC design pattern.
  
  - [TO DO app](https://github.com/Blagoja95/todo-app) that store locally user's tasks and theme preference. For this project I created a detailed README document that outlines the app's underpinning work and my thinking process, with a focus on implementation of MVC design pattern and creation of UI components.
    
- [Automatic garden watering system](https://github.com/Blagoja95/automatic-garden-watering-sys-aurdion) irrigation system that opens the valve and discharges water at apredetermined time. The first version of this system was made in 2020 and the upgraded version is still used today. Project made on Arduino platform together with other components, written in C++.

- [Advice generator](https://blagoja95.github.io/advice-generator-app-challenge-hub) that I made together with my buddy [Denzel95](https://github.com/Denzel95), where we practice teamwork and version control. Also, this was a great project to practice async/await and how to handle promises.

- [My personal page](https://blagoja95.github.io/borisblagojevic.github.io/), made it with HTML, SASS. Used JS for display the mobile menu, changing languages and storing user preferences locally.
