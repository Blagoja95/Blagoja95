  Projects that I'm proud of:
  </h2>
  
   - [Image gallery w/ PIXABAY API](https://blagoja95.github.io/image-gallery-pixabayAPI-tailwind-react/) is front end application that allows its user to search the enormous amount of images. The user can search any image by typing in a desired keyword like 'cats' or 'cars' and the get a list of images present that to the user as a card with image and data about that image. Filter those search results by selecting the type of image like photos, vectors and illustrations.
   
  - [Recipe app](https://recipe-app-demo-bb.netlify.app)  allows its user to search over a million of different recipes. Add new recipes, filter recipes by keyword like ingredient or find specific recipe with a search bar. A user also has the option of creating their own recipe. This application is made with the MVC design pattern.
  
  - [TO DO app](https://github.com/Blagoja95/todo-app) that store locally user's todos and layout theme preference. Made with the MVC design pattern.

- [Automatic garden watering system](https://github.com/Blagoja95/automatic-garden-watering-sys-aurdion) that helps me water my garden every day trough summer. Made first version in 2020 and used it ever since.

- [Advice generator](https://blagoja95.github.io/advice-generator-app-challenge-hub) that I made together with my buddy [Denzel95](https://github.com/Denzel95), where we practice teamwork and version control. Also, this was a great project to practice async/await.

- [My personal page](https://blagoja95.github.io/borisblagojevic.github.io/), made in HTML, SASS and a bit of JavaScript to display the mobile menu, select languages and to store user preferences locally.
